==========         Notes      =====================================================================

Briofita is a color scheme whose background shows by default a shaded dark green color. Different file types may
have different renderings for similar items; different items stand out by having different colors. It has many highlights
for common programming languages and text mark-up schemes. It is recommended both for low-light and normal-light
conditions. Some high contrast colors like red or orange, and underlined or reversed text, are used in a few items in
each syntax.

Initially based on Moss (vimscript #2779), with some ideas coming from Distinguished (vimscript #3529), the
current release departs a lot from its origins.

A global dictionary allows alternatives to some default highlights, with a few coupled settings.
All options are defined via numeric parameters designed to enable user functions or plugins to
easily make option "rotation" by clicking on menus or toolbar buttons.

Please notice that all the development and testing efforts took place under Linux. 

Any feedback is welcome. (Our fellow vimmers will benefit if you remember to "rate this script"...)


==========        Help      =================================================================================
Technical details (and the release history) were previously here in the Vim Online page.
They have now been moved into the companion help file.
Do ":help briofita" to read the help.

==========        Options      =================================================================================
Most users will not need to use the options provided by the color scheme, since 
there are appropriate defaults, they just need to do ":color briofita" on the Vim command-line for a start.
But those users who want may try and change the highlight groups via numeric choices.
Please check the help file for details.

==========        Plugin      =================================================================================
An example plugin is provided: briofita-support.vim.
It has an example of a function that commands the cycling of the CursorLine
highlight. And another example function can be called to create a menu that performs some useful operations.
 (Some menu entries assume you have installed the "tabpagecolorscheme" plugin, vimscript #3358).
For more details please check the help file.
