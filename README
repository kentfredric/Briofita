Briofita is a complex dark background GUI colorscheme with highlights for common programming languages and light 
mark-up tools, usable under both low-light and normal-light conditions. Although it is heavier than most common Vim 
colorschemes it runs smoothly on current computers (at least I have been using it for the last two years with no issue).  

Briofita implements colorscheme highlights for many syntax elements and fulfills study, research and work needs. A 
global dictionary allows optional values to some syntax elements whose highlights may easily be changed either 
manually or via plugins. 

The companion plugin provides GUI menus that make it easy to change Briofita settings, but the colorscheme 
may be used without it. A Vim help file explains its history, usage and technical details.

The current version of Briofita was tested only under GNU/Linux. The colorscheme does not use any special operating 
system feature and should run properly under other environments, but the  plugin behavior under these systems is unknown. 

Feedback is welcome. Our fellow vimmers will benefit if you remember to "rate this script"...
