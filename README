==========         Notes      =====================================================================

Briofita is a color scheme whose background shows by default a shaded dark green color. Different file types may 
have different renderings for similar items; different items stand out by having different colors. It has many highlights 
for common programming languages and text mark-up schemes. Some high contrast colors (like red or orange), 
underlined or reversed text are used in a few items in each syntax (for example, Python indentation errors are 
shown in orange). 

Global variable options allow alternatives to the default ColorColumn, Normal and CursorLineNr highlights. There are
coupled settings for CursorLine/CursorColumn and Search/DiffText. All options are defined via numeric parameters 
designed to enable user functions or plugins to easily make option "rotation" by clicking on menus or toolbar buttons.

Originally this color scheme was just a tweaked version of Moss (vimscript #2779), with few changes for personal 
preferences; inspired by other favorite color schemes, other features were added along the time; then it was 
restructured to use a color dictionary similar to the one used by the Distinguished color scheme (vimscript #3529).

Any feedback is welcome. 

==========        Options      =================================================================================
Most users will not need to use the options provided by the color scheme, since there are appropriate defaults. 
But those who want may try and change the highlight groups via the numeric choices shown below. Typically the 
commands with the user choices will be placed in the '.vimrc' file.
For the CursorLine settings I recommend that you create toolbar buttons (or menu entries) so that each time you 
click on them a new option is in effect for the current tabpage. Such that you have a quick and easy rotation 
between these settings. These tabpage settings will be easier if you use the TabPageColorscheme 
plugin (vimscript #3358). (For creating menus or toobar buttons look at Vim ':help creating-menus' or ':help gui-toolbar'.)

==========        ColorColumn Highlight Options     ==============================================================
Option Variable:  'g:Briofita_choice_for_colorcolumn'
 (For an explanation of ColorColumn check ":help colorcolumn". )  Its color may be changed with the options below:
  0 --> ColorColumn background is #294C44 (green; DEFAULT)
  1 --> if the CursorLine option does not have Black background (if it is not 8), then ColorColumn will have the SAME background;
           otherwise the ColorColumn will be almost hidden in the background.
  2 --> ColorColumn background is #004F4F (sort of green with some blue touch)

========               Search  Highlight Options       ================================================================
Option Variable:  'g:Briofita_choice_for_search'
This allows you to change the highlight style of the normal mode star (*) and search (/) commands, for example.  
Notice that there are a few settings for DiffText highlight coupled with this variable (try this and let me know your suggestions
for change or improvements in a future release). I prefer the Search highlight to be VERY contrasting, so "0" is the default. 
But you may change this with the options below:
  0 --> sort of gold foreground, and bright red background (DEFAULT)
  1 --> equal to the above default (in this release)
  2 --> sort of gold foreground, dark red background
  3 --> sort of light green background 
  4 --> sort of green foreground, bright yellow/green background 
  5 --> underlined rose text

==========          Normal Highlight Options    ===================================================================
Option Variable: 'g:Briofita_choice_for_normalcolor'
This is the highlight group for the common text. When the file you are  currently editing has a syntax that makes 
TOO MUCH text  to be "Normal" you may want something different from the default. 
Sometimes I use options  1 or 2 below when there is no alternative for a poorly tested syntax.
  0 --> sort of light purple/cyan foreground (DEFAULT)
  1 --> very light green foreground (hacked from Moss colorscheme)
  2 --> a weird color (amber? tangerine? carrot?... try yourself  and tell me...)

=========            CursorLineNr    Highlight  Options      ============================================================
Option Variable: 'g:Briofita_choice_for_cursorlinenr'
 Line number highlight, meaningful only for recent versions of Vim. Options:
  0 --> orange (DEFAULT)
  1 --> yellow

=========       CursorLine  and  CursorColumn  Highlight  Options   ==================================================
Option Variables:  'g:Briofita_choice_for_cursorline'    and    't:Briofita_choice_for_cursorline'
These variables affect both CursorLine and CursorColumn highlights. If you do not usually have 'cursorline' or 
'cursorcolumn' set in your Vim, you may skip this. The two variables above (notice that their names differ only in the prefix)
enable an easy change of the CursorLine and the CursorColumn style.
** If you want the same CursorLine/CursorColumn style in all your tabpages, just set the "g:" variable above mentioned; 
    do not set or change the "t:" variable.
** If you want a different CursorLine/CursorColumn style for the current tabpage then do as follows:
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        set t:Briofita_choice_for_cursorline=3        ====> FOR THE TABPAGE WHERE YOU ARE
        set g:Briofita_choice_for_cursorline=(-1)   ====> ONLY ONCE
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The options are:
   0 --> #333399  (blue background, DEFAULT)
   1 --> #3A5022  (green background)
   2 --> #880c0e  (red background)
   3 --> Navy Blue background
   4 --> Dark Magenta background
   5 --> Saddle Brown background
   6 --> #333399 (same background as in option 0; but white foreground, and line without syntax colors)
   7 --> #3A5022 (same background as in option 1; but white foreground, and line without syntax colors)
   8 --> Black background, green foreground, underlined; line without syntax colors

==========           Example            ==============================================================
Issue the command below in Vim command line. It changes the Search highlight to use a different red background, 
not so bright as the default:
        	----------------------------------------------------------------
	        	     :g:Briofita_choice_for_search = 2
        	---------------------------------------------------------------
Notice that the effect of this command may not be immediate because the color scheme is not aware of command line 
events. You may need to source it with the command ':colorscheme briofita'; if you used the TabPageColorscheme 
plugin to set it as a local tab color, it may be re-sourced by clicking on another tabpage and then clicking back on 
the original tab. (This is just an example for the command line. The proper place for settings like these is in a script like .vimrc).

=====  v1.5.0+   ===========================================================================================
                 A string with the colorscheme version number is shown if you issue a command like this example:
                                        :echo g:BriofitaVersion()
                 If Briofita is the current color, some parameter information is shown, too.
=====  v1.5.0+   ===========================================================================================
                 Some support for distraction-less editing has been added. In this mode some visual elements have low visibility or are
                 almost hidden. Although you will likely need companion settings with commands like :set nonumber (and others) in 
                 your .vimrc (or in a plugin, not yet provided). Here is an example of usage:
                                                                      :let t:Briofita_no_distraction_mode=0                        (accepted values: 0 or 1)
                 * Then do 
                                                                       :colorscheme briofita                                                   (to reload the colorscheme);
                 * When done (BEFORE proceeding to normal mode editing):
                                           ** either (in the same tab) DELETE it with  :unlet  t:Briofita_no_distraction_mode
                                           ** or CLOSE the tabpage. 
                                           ** reload the colorscheme again
                 Note: The examples use the command line, but the recommended usage is in scripts (.vimrc/.gvimrc, function, map or plugin).
